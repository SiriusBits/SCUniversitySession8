# Do my items assign rights to users?
#
# Sitecore recommendation:
#    Apply security to roles rather than users â€” 
#      We recommend that you configure security rights for a role security account rather than a user account. 
#      Even if there is only one user in the system with this unique access level, 
#      it is still better to have permissions configured for a role account. 
#      It is much easier to maintain a security system in which all the security configuration is set on role security accounts.
#
# Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "/sitecore/content/My Site"
#
# How to read this report?
# ------------------------
# The report will show you all items that restrict rights rather than break inheritance, potantially breaking this recommendation.
# It does not necessarily mean that the approach is wrong, but you should consider restructuring your security setting 
# according to the Sitecore best practice.
