# Do my items restrict access rights?
#
# Sitecore recommendation:
#    Break inheritance rather than explicitly deny access rights â€” 
#      It is a recommended practice to break inheritance in cases where the access right should be denied 
#      instead of explicitly denying it for a security account. If you deny an access right explicitly to a security account, 
#      the only way to override this denial of access is to do it directly on a user account. 
#      This creates an overhead in security management when you would like a user to inherit this role and some other role 
#      that should allow the same right access.
#
# Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to where you store your solution templates e.g. "/sitecore/content/My Site"
#
# How to read this report?
# ------------------------
# The report will show you all items that restrict rights rather than break inheritance, potantially breaking this recommendation.
# It does not necessarily mean that the approach is wrong, but you should consider restructuring your security setting 
# according to the Sitecore best practice.
