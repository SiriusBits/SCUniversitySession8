# Sitecore recommendation:
#    Limit the number of items under any given node that share the same parent, to 100 items or less for performance and usability.

# Before executing this script point the "Context Item" to your site e.g. "Sitecore/content/My Site"

# How to read this report?
# ------------------------
# The report will show you all the nodes that have more than 50 direct descendants to allow you to address any potential issues arising. 
# If the list is empty (no results shown) it means your solution is not even close to violating the recommendation and you can give yourself a pat on the back.
